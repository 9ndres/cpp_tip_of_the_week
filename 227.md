* **Did you know that `std::variant` become valueless by exception?**

  * (guaranteed) an exception is thrown during the move initialization of the contained value from the temporary in copy assignment
  * (guaranteed) an exception is thrown during the move initialization of the contained value during move assignment
  * (optionally) an exception is thrown when initializing the contained value during a type-changing assignment
  * (optionally) an exception is thrown when initializing the contained value during a type-changing emplace

```cpp
struct foo {
  foo() = default;
  foo(const foo&) { throw 42; }
};

int main() {
  std::variant<int, foo> v{42};
  assert(not v.valueless_by_exception());

  try {
    v = foo{}; // throws
  } catch(...) { }

  assert(v.valueless_by_exception());
}
```

* **Can you implement `throws` class in order to satisfy guaranteed variant valueless by exception tests?**

```cpp
int main() {
  using namespace boost::ut;
  using namespace boost::ut::spec;

  describe("variant - valuless by exception") = [] {
      it("should valuless by exception when an exception is thrown during the move initialization of the contained value from the temporary in copy assignment") = [] {
        struct throws; // TODO
        std::variant<std::monostate, throws> v{};
        expect(not v.valueless_by_exception() and 0_i == v.index());

        try {
          // TODO
        } catch(...) { }

        expect(v.valueless_by_exception());
        expect(std::variant_npos == v.index());
      };

      it("should valuless by exception when an exception is thrown during the move initialization of the contained value during move assignment") = [] {
        struct throws; // TODO
        std::variant<std::monostate, throws> v{};
        expect(not v.valueless_by_exception() and 0_i == v.index());

        try {
          // TODO
        } catch(...) { }

        expect(v.valueless_by_exception());
        expect(std::variant_npos == v.index());
      };
  };
}
```
